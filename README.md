# Aplicación Mexi-Macros
Mexi-Macros – Personal Nutrition & Fitness Tracker
This application allows users to log in or register to access their personalized account.
When registering, users create a username and password, and provide details such as name, age, weight, and height.

Based on this information, the app calculates daily calorie needs depending on the user’s exercise activity. For example, someone who strength trains 3 times per week will have different calorie requirements than a person who trains 5 times per week.

By adjusting for training frequency and activity level, Mexi-Macros helps users better understand their caloric needs and supports them in reaching their fitness goals.
